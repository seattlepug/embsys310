## Q3 
information from Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code
a) What is Morse Code:
* it has two different signal durations: **dots** and **dashes**
* there are a list of standardized sequences of these two signals, which encodes 26 English letters, some non-English letters, the Arabic numerals and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals (prosigns)
* The letters of a word are separated by a space of duration equal to three dots, and the words are separated by a space equal to seven dots
* it is named after Samuel Morse, an inventor of the telegraph

b) the development of Morse Code 
* the development of Morse Code stems from the development of telegrah, as there was a need to transmit natural language into electrical pulses, and silence between them
* there has been several versions, and evolutions of the Morse Code. Samnual Morse proposed a version. There was another version developed by William Cooke and Charles Wheatstone from Britain. 
* The current ITU (International Telecommunication Union) standard seems to be the mostly adopted version

## Q4
As per the code, my first name is Zhe, which will be translated into:
Z: - - . . (dah-dah-di-dit) 
h: . . . . (di-di-di-dit)
e: . (dit)

Also, I am following Wikipedia convention:
Each single "dit" will be the base duration
Each "dah" is three times the length of "dit"
With the same letter/character, but between each dit/dah, there will be one pause, equals to one "dit" duration. 
With the same word, but between each letter/charater, there will be a longer pause, equals to three "dit" duration
between each word, there will be even a longer pause, equals to six "dit" duration
