**This submission included Q5, which uses STM32CubeMX to generate blinking LEDs, other portion of the assignment is the same as previous submission**
## Q5
I wanted to circle back on this assignment first, as it is the first time we used STM32CubeMX, just so that I am more comfortable using this tool before I tackle assignment08. Using this tool made me appreciate the ease of making blinking happen. On the other hand, I appreciate more the effort we put into this course to understand what is "behind the scene". 
My implementation toggles both LEDs, with offset.
